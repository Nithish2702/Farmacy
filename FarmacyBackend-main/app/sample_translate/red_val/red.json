    "crop_name": "Red Gram (Pigeon Pea)",
    "crop_variety": "ICPL 14003 (PRG 176, Ujwala)",
    "crop_code": "ICPL 14003",
    "cultivated_in": "Telangana, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, and other semi-arid regions of India",
    "crop_desc": "ICPL 14003, also known as PRG 176 or Ujwala, is a high-yielding, medium-duration red gram variety developed by ICRISAT. It matures in 150–180 days, is resistant to sterility mosaic and Fusarium wilt, and is well-suited for both rainfed and irrigated conditions. The variety is prized for its bold, high-protein seeds and adaptability to intercropping systems, making it a reliable choice for food security and income generation in drought-prone areas.",
    "cultivation_overview": "ICPL 14003 thrives in well-drained loamy soils with a pH of 6.5–7.5 and requires 600–1000 mm annual rainfall. Land should be deeply ploughed, leveled, and enriched with organic manure. Use certified, treated seeds (12–15 kg/ha) and sow directly in rows or, rarely, via nursery. Maintain 60x30 cm spacing for sole cropping. Apply balanced fertilizers (N, P, S) and biofertilizers at sowing, with top-dressing as needed. The crop is mainly rainfed in kharif but needs irrigation in summer or dry spells, especially at germination, flowering, and pod formation. Keep fields weed-free for the first 30–45 days, use pre-emergence herbicides, and monitor for pests (pod borer, aphids) and diseases (SMD, wilt). Harvest when 75–80% of pods mature and turn brown, then dry, thresh, clean, and store seeds in moisture-proof containers. The variety yields 1.5–2.5 tons/ha under optimal management and is valued for its resilience, high protein content, and suitability for sustainable, integrated farming systems."

    "crop_code": "ICPH 2740",
    "cultivated_in": "Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, and other semi-arid regions of peninsular India",
    "crop_desc": "ICPH 2740, also known as Mannem Konda Kandi, is a high-yielding, wilt- and sterility mosaic-resistant pigeonpea hybrid developed by ICRISAT. Released in 2015, it is bred using CMS and natural cross-pollination, offering 36–41% higher yields than traditional varieties. The hybrid matures in 150–180 days, is suitable for rainfed and irrigated conditions, and is valued for its bold seeds, strong disease resistance, and adaptability to dryland farming systems.",
    "cultivation_overview": "ICPH 2740 thrives in deep, well-drained loamy or sandy loam soils with a pH of 6.0–7.5. Prepare the land with deep ploughing, harrowing, and organic manure. Use certified hybrid seeds, treat with Rhizobium and fungicide, and sow in raised nursery beds or directly in the field. Transplant seedlings at 100x100 cm or 120x120 cm spacing for optimal yields. Apply balanced fertilizers (N, P, K), organic inputs, and micronutrients as needed. The crop is mainly rainfed but benefits from irrigation at flowering and pod formation. Keep fields weed-free, use pre-emergence herbicides, and monitor for pod borers and foliar diseases. Harvest when 70–80% of pods are brown and dry, then dry, thresh, clean, and store seeds at 8–10% moisture in cool, dry, pest-free conditions. The hybrid yields 2.4–3.6 tons/ha under good management and is prized for its high productivity, resilience, and market value."

    "crop_code": "Tandur Red Gram",
    "cultivated_in": "Tandur, Vikarabad, Narayanpet, Sangareddy, Adilabad, and other rainfed regions of Telangana, India",
    "crop_desc": "Tandur Red Gram, also known as Tandur Kandi Pappu or Tur Dal, is a GI-tagged pigeon pea variety grown mainly in the rainfed black soils of Tandur taluka and neighboring districts in Telangana. It is valued for its superior flavor, high protein content (22–24%), and excellent cooking and storage qualities. The crop is a staple and cash crop for over 63,000 farming families, supporting the local economy and culture.",
    "cultivation_overview": "Tandur Red Gram thrives in fertile, deep black soils rich in potassium and calcium, with minimal chemical herbicide use. Land is ploughed 2–3 times, leveled, and enriched with 10 tons/acre of FYM. Use certified seeds (2–3 kg/acre for Kharif, 6–8 kg/acre for Rabi), treat with fungicide or Trichoderma, and sow directly or in raised beds. Transplant seedlings at 60x30 cm (Kharif) or 45x20 cm (Rabi) spacing. Apply organic and chemical fertilizers as per soil test, and irrigate only if needed. Keep fields weed-free with pre-emergence herbicide and hand weeding. Monitor for pod borers, wilt, and powdery mildew; use biopesticides and crop rotation. Harvest when pods turn brown and dry, then dry, thresh, clean, and store seeds in moisture-proof bags. The GI tag enables premium pricing and branding, making it a high-value crop for local and export markets."
