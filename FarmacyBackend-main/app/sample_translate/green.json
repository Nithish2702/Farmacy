    "crop_desc": "WGG 42, also known as Yadadri, is a high-yielding, extra-early maturing green gram (mungbean) variety developed by PJTSAU, Hyderabad. It is Telangana's most popular green gram, maturing in 55–60 days, with high yield potential (10–12 quintals/ha), uniform maturity, long pods, bold shiny seeds, and strong resistance to Mungbean Yellow Mosaic Virus (MYMV). Its adaptability to multiple seasons and robust agronomic traits make it a reliable and profitable choice for farmers.",
    "cultivation_overview": "WGG 42 (Yadadri) is sown at the onset of the season with 30 x 10 cm spacing, using quality, treated seeds. It thrives in well-drained loamy or sandy-loam soils, with timely irrigation at flowering and pod development. Integrated nutrient management and IPM practices are recommended, including seed treatment, regular field monitoring, and timely weeding. The variety's early maturity allows for flexible cropping, and its MYMV resistance reduces losses and input costs. Harvest when 80–85% of pods are dry, and follow proper post-harvest handling for best quality and market value."
