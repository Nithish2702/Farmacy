    "crop_code": "PU-31",
    "cultivated_in": "Uttarakhand, northern plains, and adaptable to rainfed and irrigated regions of India including Telangana",
    "crop_desc": "PU-31 (Pant Urd 31) is a high-yielding, early-maturing, open-pollinated black gram variety developed by G.B. Pant University. It matures in 75–85 days, is moderately resistant to yellow mosaic virus and powdery mildew, and is valued for its bold, glossy seeds, good cooking quality, and adaptability to diverse soils and cropping systems. The variety is popular for its high productivity, resilience, and suitability for both household and commercial use.",
    "cultivation_overview": "PU-31 thrives in well-drained loamy to black soils with a pH of 6–7. Prepare the land with ploughing, harrowing, and organic manure. Use certified, treated seeds (6–8 kg/acre), sow directly in rows or broadcast, and maintain 30x10–15 cm spacing. Apply balanced fertilizers (N, P, K), biofertilizers, and organic inputs as needed. The crop is mainly rainfed in kharif but benefits from irrigation at flowering and pod formation. Keep fields weed-free, use pre-sowing herbicides, and monitor for stem fly, pod borer, and yellow mosaic virus. Harvest when 80–90% of pods are black, then dry, thresh, clean, and store seeds at 8–10% moisture in cool, dry, pest-free conditions. The variety yields 10–12 quintals/ha under optimal management and is valued for its reliability, disease resistance, and market value."
